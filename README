Framework for defining and working on domain languages.

MPS needs to have 2 path variables defined

M2_REPO = location of maven repository (D:/.m2/repository)
IMAGES_DIR = icons for concepts (C:/Workspace/smart-forms/images)

Currently, M2_REPO is used for referencing used java libs:
${M2_REPO}/org/hibernate/hibernate-annotations/3.4.0.GA/hibernate-annotations-3.4.0.GA.jar
${M2_REPO}/com/extjs/gxt/2.2.0/gxt-2.2.0.jar
